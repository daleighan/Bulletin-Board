There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  DIY Show Bulleten Board

## Sub-Heading ##
  This is an online bulleten board for the posting and discussion of DIY show flyers that should be similar in purpose to a bulleten board at a record store.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  The benefit of this product is that it allows users to find out about the same kinds of shows they would find out about on the bulleten boards of record stores. This is information that is often hard to find online, and without the word of mouth and obtaining of physical flyers, it is often impossible.

## Problem ##
  The problem is that it is often hard to find information about DIY shows on the internet. This app would show you flyers for DIY shows in one unified place. 

## Solution ##
  The product elegantly solves the problem by putting a number of show flyers in one place. On the internet, they are most oftem found on facebook, where there is no unified way to find all of the similar events and view them in one place.

## Quote from You ##
  "Bulleten Board: Helping you find DIY shows in your area"

## How to Get Started ##
  Just enter a username, see the posted flyers and discuss them!

## Customer Quote ##
  "In the past, I only found out about shows by word of mouth or if I had a physical flyer. Now, I can find them on the internet."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  Use the app and go to more shows!
